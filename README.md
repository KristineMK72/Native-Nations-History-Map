# Native-Nations-History-Map
# 🌿 Echoes of the Land: Indigenous History Story Map

## Project Overview
This interactive web map tells the story of the Indigenous presence, migration, and forced relocation across North America, focusing primarily on the United States. It combines historical geographic data with modern tribal boundaries to provide a comprehensive visual narrative.

The map is built using **Leaflet.js**, HTML, and CSS, featuring a dark, high-contrast visual theme.

## Key Features

* **574 Tribal Locations:** Displays the approximate geographic locations of all 574 Federally Recognized Tribes in the contiguous U.S. as dense, interactive green dots.
* **Dual Historical Routes:** Visualizes two significant paths:
    * **The Trail of Tears:** A forced removal route (Red polyline).
    * **The Ojibwe Migration Route:** A historical route following cultural prophecy (Cyan polyline).
* **Interactive Narrative:** Features specific **Story Markers** linked to historical eras (e.g., Beringia Crossing, Mississippian Culture, Dakota Conflict) that allow users to fly to the geographic location of that historical event.
* **Toggleable Layers:** Users can toggle layers for **Tribal Reservations** (polygons) and **Historical Trails** for a cleaner view.
* **Ambient Audio:** Includes optional ambient Pow Wow drumming to enhance the cultural atmosphere (requires user interaction to start).

## Getting Started
